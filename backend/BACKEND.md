Introduction
The Ski Resort Management System is designed to optimize the distribution of skiers across various resorts. By analyzing historical and real-time data, the system provides insights into visitor patterns, predicts high-traffic areas, and suggests optimal routes. This ensures a smoother experience for visitors, with minimal waiting times and reduced overcrowding.
Installation

Usage
Here's how to use the Ski Resort Management System:
Data Loader: The DataLoader class in data_loader.py handles data loading and preprocessing. It reads data from a CSV file, splits it into training and testing sets, and prepares the data for model training.
Model Training: Use train_model.py to train the recommendation model. It utilizes collaborative filtering to provide personalized location recommendations based on user data.
Analysis: analyze_data.py allows for the analysis of visitor data, providing insights into visitor patterns and behavior.
Features
Predictive Analytics: Forecast high-traffic areas and times to improve skier distribution.
Real-Time Monitoring: Collect real-time data on skier locations and wait times.
Dynamic Recommendations: Provide personalized recommendations to visitors based on their preferences and past behavior.
Data Visualization: Visualize visitor patterns and model performance for better decision-making.
Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Surprise (for collaborative filtering)
Flask (for web interface)
Matplotlib (for data visualization)
