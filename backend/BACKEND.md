## Introduction
The Ski Resort Management System is designed to optimize the distribution of skiers across various resorts. By analyzing historical and real-time data, the system provides insights into visitor patterns, predicts high-traffic areas, and suggests optimal routes. This ensures a smoother experience for visitors, with minimal waiting times and reduced overcrowding.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ski-resort-management.git


## Usage
Here's how to use the Ski Resort Management System:

1. **Data Loader**: The `DataLoader` class in `data_loader.py` handles data loading and preprocessing. It reads data from a CSV file, splits it into training and testing sets, and prepares the data for model training.

2. **Model Training**: Use `train_model.py` to train the recommendation model. It utilizes collaborative filtering to provide personalized location recommendations based on user data.

3. **Analysis**: `analyze_data.py` allows for the analysis of visitor data, providing insights into visitor patterns and behavior.

## Features
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecast high-traffic areas and times to improve skier distribution.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Collect real-time data on skier locations and wait times.
- **Dynamic Recommendations**: Provide personalized recommendations to visitors based on their preferences and past behavior.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize visitor patterns and model performance for better decision-making.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Surprise** (for collaborative filtering)
- **Flask** (for web interface)
- **Matplotlib** (for data visualization)
